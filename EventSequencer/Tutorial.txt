Gray highlighted text means that there are no recordings assigned to the text.

Green highlighted text means there is a recording assigned.

RECORDING AND ASSIGNING

1. On the top tab bar, select the Record tab.
2. Press the Record button on the bottom and read some text. Press Stop when you are done.
3. Tap on the document to mark the beginning of the text you have read.
4. Press the Select button to toggle the selection.
5. Tap on the document to mark the end of the text you have read.
6. Press the Assign button.
7. Notice that the text is now highlighted in green.

It is ideal to assign ranges consecutively without leaving space in between. From the Document tab, there is an option to scroll to the next unassigned location. If you assign ranges consecutively, this will help you easily scroll to where you left off last time so you can continue reading.

PLAYING BACK

Now that you have recorded yourself reading some text, let's play them back! Click on the Play tab.

The ComboBox lets you choose what to play.

You may wonder what the "Review Unassigned Recording" is for. After you've made a recording, you can use the option to listen to the recording and determine if you wish to assign it.

The "Tone" option helps you start speaking on the specified pitch if that is your goal.

I MISASSIGNED

If you accidentally make the wrong assignment, put your cursor on the incorrect assignment and go to the File tab. In the Strips subtab, select the Strip that represents your wrong assignment. Press the Delete button and you will have the option to reclaim the recording as the unassigned recording, and you can assign it again in the Record tab.

WORKFLOW AUTOMATION

Once you are comfortable with using the application, File -> Settings has a few options to automate your workflow. This will enable you to read quickly without pressing as many buttons.
